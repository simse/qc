Installing `qc` is quite easy, and afterwards it can update itself to the newest version. That's pretty neat.

## Windows
Download the .msi installer.

## macOS
On macOS it's recommended to use Homebrew.

**Add the repo**
```
brew tap simse/brew
```

**Install qc**
```
brew install qc
```

## Linux
For all distros, it's recommended to use the install script found here.

Some distros have native packages.

### Ubuntu/Debian
Download the .deb

### Fedora
Download the .rpm
